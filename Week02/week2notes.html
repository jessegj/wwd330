        Notes and Questions: Week 2<br>
   
    This week I wanted to take notes on things I need to work on when writing code, 
    and things I may have forgotten.<br><br>

        Javascript comment types are ‘//’ for a single line and ‘/* */’ for a longer phrase. Before writing a function make a comment on the description.<br>
        The keyword ‘const’ is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, while ‘let’ is used if the variable might be assigned later in the program.<br>
        Block scope – only exists in a block they already are in.<br>
        Global scope is outside the block.<br>
        Local scope is defined inside a block of ‘let’ or ‘const’ and it cannot be used outside it.<br>
    What is the role of ‘Symbol();’?<br> 
    Dry code – code should only be used once, to avoid duplication.
