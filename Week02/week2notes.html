        Notes and Questions: Week 2
   
    This week I wanted to take notes on things I need to work on when writing code, 
    and things I may have forgotten.

        Javascript comment types are ‘//’ for a single line and ‘/* */’ for a longer phrase. Before writing a function make a comment on the description.
        The keyword ‘const’ is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, while ‘let’ is used if the variable might be assigned later in the program.
        Block scope – only exists in a block they already are in.
        Global scope is outside the block.
        Local scope is defined inside a block of ‘let’ or ‘const’ and it cannot be used outside it.
    What is the role of ‘Symbol();’? 
    Dry code – code should only be used once, to avoid duplication.
