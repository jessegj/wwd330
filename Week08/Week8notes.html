    <p>Transform property is one or more transform functions that are applied in the order they are provided.
        Translation functions are like position: relative. They allow you to move the object along the x and y axis. 
        <br><br> 
        
        Different things that can be done with transform are skewed perspective, rotation, and scaling. Order matters, plan carefully to reach the effect you want. <br><br>

        Transitions allows CSS properties to change over time, using simple animations. Steps are first, declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration. Declare the final state, then include the transition functions.
