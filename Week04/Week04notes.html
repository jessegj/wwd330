Week 4 Notes

Reset method not good for usability, to easy to wipe out information. Think before you use it!

-Prototype Property-
The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared. Prototype is live this mean that new instances of a class of an object will inherit new properties and methods automatically(even if it has been created). Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype!!!!!
Prototype is supposed to be used to add new methods and properties when the class has been declared.

-Enumerable properties will not show up in a for loop. propertyIsEnumerable() is a check to see if a property is enumerable. Every object has one.
A class can inherit from another class using extend. 
Polymorphism is objecys having the same methods but used in different ways.
A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another without using inheritance.
