    <p>The call() works as ‘this’ when ‘this is not used, null must be used as the first argument. Apply method works the same way but<br>
        the arguments provided in the function are an array(null is still the first argument).  Cache Property can save a return value. <br><br>
        
        Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) – an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it is<br> 
        defined. This is a good way to use temporarily variables. They will only be used when the function is<br> 
        called and then they will disappear. This also helps create code blocks that are able to run independently <br>
        of each other.<br><br> 
        
        Callbacks are functions passed to other function and then invoked inside the function they are passed<br>
        to. This helps the code to be processed out of order or asynchronously. You have to be careful with<br>
        Callbacks so we do not create spaghetti code.<br><br>

        Promise represents a future result of an asynchronous operation. A promise runs through a cycle. After<br> 
        it is created it goes to pending while it takes place. Then to settled promise can have a resolved or<br> 
        rejected result. It is created using a constructor function.
